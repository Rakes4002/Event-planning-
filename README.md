# Event-planning-
Project Description
EventPlanning DAO is a revolutionary decentralized autonomous organization built on the Stacks blockchain that empowers communities to collaboratively organize, fund, and manage events. This smart contract-based platform enables community members to propose events, collectively fund them through STX contributions, and share in the profits generated from successful events.
The platform democratizes event planning by removing traditional barriers and intermediaries, allowing anyone to propose events ranging from conferences and workshops to festivals and community gatherings. Contributors who fund events earn profit-sharing rights proportional to their investment, creating a sustainable ecosystem where successful events benefit the entire community.
Project Vision
Our vision is to transform the event planning industry by creating a transparent, community-driven ecosystem where:

Democratized Event Creation: Anyone can propose and organize events without traditional gatekeepers
Collective Funding: Communities can pool resources to bring amazing events to life
Transparent Profit Sharing: Fair distribution of event profits based on contribution levels
Decentralized Governance: Community members have voting power proportional to their involvement
Global Accessibility: Remove geographical and financial barriers to event participation and organization
Trust Through Transparency: All transactions and profit distributions recorded immutably on the blockchain

We envision a world where the best event ideas get funded and executed through community support, regardless of the organizer's background or initial capital. This creates opportunities for innovative events that might never have existed in traditional funding models.
